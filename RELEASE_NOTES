Apache FlexJS 0.0.2
=================

Apache FlexJS is a next-generation Flex SDK that provides the capability
to cross-compile MXML and AS applications to HTML/JS/CSS so they can run
in a browser without Flash.

This is the second release of Apache FlexJS.  It is an 'alpha' type of release.
Expect to find lots of bugs and missing features.

Known Issues
_____________

Adobe Flash Builder Integration

Flash Builder will not generate correct MXML when generating a new Flex Project
that uses an Apache FlexJS SDK.  It is recommended that you copy an the MXML
for the main application from one of the FlexJS example applications.  More details
can be found on the Apache Flex Wiki at: 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLEX/Using+FlexJS+with+Adobe+Flash+Builder

Examples and Compiler Warnings

Several of the Examples will have compiler warnings in the output and return
an exit code of 2.  But they still be operational.

Building the Examples

There are several examples in the "examples" folder.  Use "ant examples" from the
SDK's build.xml to build them.  Building them individually may result in errors.
The DataBindingTest is the most up-to-date example and should allow both the SWF
version and cross-compiled version to select one of the stock symbols from
the drop down and hit a button to get a stock price.  Some of other the examples 
may not cross-compile or work correctly.

Java Version Mismatch

If you get an error: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
org/apache/flex/compiler/clients/MXMLJSC : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0 (or a
larger number), this indicates that FlexJS is trying to use Java 6 to compile cross-
compile the application.  Check the path to Java specified in the js/bin/mxmlc or 
js/bin/mxmlc.bat file.  You may have to modify it to point to a Java 7 JDK.  If the
error occurred when using one of the Flash Builder launch configurations, try
running the js/bin/mxmlc or js/bin/mxmlc.bat file from the command line.

"${project_loc}" Error

You may get the following error using one of the Flash Builder launch configurations:
    
    Variable references empty selection: ${project_loc}

This indicates that Flash Builder cannot determine which project in the workspace is
the active project.  Click on the project in the Package Explorer, or on a file in the
editor that belongs to that project before using the launch configuration.
