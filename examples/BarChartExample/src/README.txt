This example demonstrates how to construct a BarChart. The example shows a chart
with two BarSeries on the same axis. 

The MyInitialView file references <basic:BarChart>. However, you will also find
a complete copy of the BarChart source (strand, beads, etc.) in this project 
contained in the org.apache.flex.html.custom package. This copy can be cross-
compiled into JavaScript; just change <basic:BarChart> to <custom:BarChart>,
along with additional namespaces, and this chart can be displayed in HTML.
