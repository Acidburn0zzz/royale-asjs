In this file I will lay out the table of contents of the old "Flex in a Week" series, and how I would adjust that order for a new "Royale in a Week" resource.

Although I gained a lot from Flex in a Week, I found some of its structure a little odd, or not in the ideal order. Beyond that, there are features of Royale, like strands and beads, that do not exist in the old material.
