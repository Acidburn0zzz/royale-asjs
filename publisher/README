ASJS Publisher
==============

    The ASJS Publisher is a tool to cross-compile projects from ActionScript (AS) 
    to Javascript (JS). On the AS side, a project can to be built with the regular 
	Flex SDK). The Publisher collects the project's AS code and uses the FalconJx 
	compiler to create JS code. This JS code is then combined with the 
	VanillaSDK JS framework using the Google Closure Builder. This tool takes all 
	the JS files, calculates dependencies and creates one, highly optimized and 
	minified, JS file. This one JS file is combined with a minimal HTML file and 
	together these contain all code needed to play the project in a browser. For
    more information, read on.
    
Using the Publisher
===================

Prerequisites
-------------

    The ASJS Publisher relies on the Google Closure Tools:
        
        https://developers.google.com/closure/
    
    In particular it uses the Library, Compiler and Builder. In order
    to use the Publisher on your machine, you'll have to download/install these
    tools first.

    1)  Get the Google Closure Library
    
            svn checkout http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ library
        
    2)  Download the Google Closure Compiler and unzip
        
            http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip

	3)  Get the Falcon compilers 
    
    		svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/flex/falcon/trunk falcon

Preparing for publishing
------------------------

    1)  The ASJS Publisher uses the FalconJx compiler, which in turn needs the
        Falcon compiler. Build both projects using the READMEs as your guide.
    
    2)  The Publisher is an ant script, 'build.xml', which uses 
        'build.properties' and command line arguments to set dynamic properties. 
        Before your run you need to edit 'build.properties' to reflect the 
        various system specific properties.
    
Publishing
----------

    A full run ('main') of the ant script needs a single command line argument: 
    project.main.file. You point this argument to the 'master' AS (no MXML yet)
	of your project, like so:
    
        ant -Dproject.main.file=../examples/VanillaSDK_POC/src/Example.as
    
That's it, have fun!
