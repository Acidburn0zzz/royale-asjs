Vanilla Flex to Javascript (VF2JS)
==================================

Install prerequisits
____________________

- you will need to install 'ant' and 'git' on your machine
- get a release version of the Flex SDK (i.e. Apache Flex SDK 4.13.0, 
  but any other will do fine as well)



Using the source distribution
_____________________________

- open command line and 'cd' to the VF2JS directory 
- run 'ant install -Dflex.sdk.loc="[sdk.directory]"' (where 
  [sdk.directory] is the full path to the Flex SDK you want to overlay,
  i.e. "/Applications/Adobe Flash Builder 4.7/sdks/4.13.0")
  - if your 'PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME' environment variable is set to a value
    that is different from the version you chose for the Flex SDK, or
    if you have not set that environment variable, add 
    ' -DPLAYERGLOBAL_HOME=[sdk.directory]/frameworks/libs/player' to the
    end of the command



Publishing with VF2JS
_____________________

- open Flex project, select your newly overlayed Flex SDK
  in 'Project/Properties -> Flex Compiler'
- import the VF2JS launch config:
  - choose 'File/Import... -> Launch Configurations' and point
    to '[sdk.directory]/ide/flashbuilder/launch'
- to publish to JS, choose 'Run/External Tool/VF2JS (Debug and Release Build)'
